# Fuzzy Network Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a fuzzy network, a computational model based on fuzzy logic principles used for decision-making and pattern recognition tasks.

## Overview

The fuzzy network implemented here utilizes fuzzy logic to process uncertain or imprecise information. It consists of multiple interconnected nodes representing fuzzy sets and employs fuzzy inference rules to make decisions or perform pattern recognition.
